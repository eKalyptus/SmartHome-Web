# SmartHome

This is the Webinterface for the SmartHome Project. You can put this interface on the SmartHome Base (Raspberry PI for example) and control the slave Arduinos from there.

##Installation
Just put all the files in your webservers root directory or directory of choice. You can then execute the installation and setup script by adding "install.php" to your folders base address (example: localhost/SmartHome/install.php).
